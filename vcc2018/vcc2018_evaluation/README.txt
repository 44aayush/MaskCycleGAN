This README explains evaluation data and submission of the second Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC 2018). 


EVALUATION DATA 

This folder contains the evaluation data for voice transformation. 

There are eight source speakers, listed as:
Source speakers: VCC2SF1, VCC2SF2, VCC2SF3, VCC2SF4, VCC2SM1, VCC2SM2, VCC2SM3, VCC2SM4
('S' denotes 'source', while 'M' and 'F' indicate 'male' and 'female', respectively.)

They are the same source speakers included in previously released training data. 
Each speaker's folder has 35 sentences. 

HUB TASK (main task - parallel training) 
Please transform the speaker characteristics of each utterance of VCC2SF1, VCC2SF2, VCC2SM1, and VCC2SM2 to either VCC2TF1, VCC2TF2, VCC2TM1, or VCC2TM2. In the HUB task, there is a total of 16 source-target speaker pair combinations and you need to generate 16 x 35 = 560 speech waveforms. The waveforms must be RIFF/WAVE format. The sampling rate should be 22.05 kHz, and they should be stored in 16-bit format. 


SPOKE TASK (optional task - nonparallel training) 
If you also participate in the SPOKE task, please also transform speaker characteristics of each utterance of VCC2SF3, VCC2SF4, VCC2SM3, and VCC2SM4 to either VCC2TF1, VCC2TF2, VCC2TM1, or VCC2TM2. As in the HUB task, there are 16 source-target speaker pair combinations and you need to generate 16 x 35 = 560 speech waveforms. The expected waveform format is the same as that of the HUB task: RIFF/WAVE format, sampling rate of 22.05 kHz and encoded in 16-bit format.


HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR WAVEFORMS 
In order to make our evaluation preparations easier, please use the following naming structure and create a folder using your official team name. You can find your official team name in the header of e-mail that you receive from us.

Team_name/TargetID_SourceID_Task_filename.wav

For instance, a converted speech waveform of 30001.wav uttered by source speaker VCC2SF1 to target speaker VCC2TF1, for team NII and HUB task, becomes: 
NII/VCC2TF1_VCC2SF1_HUB_30001.wav

The same waveform, also for team NII, but from source speaker VCC2SF3 to target speaker VCC2TM1 in the SPOKE task would become:
NII/VCC2TM1_VCC2SF3_SPO_30001.wav

Please then zip the above folder and name it based on your team name (e.g. NII.zip) Please then send the zip file to us using Dropbox File Request below. 
https://www.dropbox.com/request/Tyiuz1Dx4XoWHatLYULA

Only if you cannot use the Dropbox File Request, please use your preferable uploading service and inform us how to download your zip file.


WITHDRAWING
Please tell us as soon as possible if your team will not be submitting the converted samples. We have a number of teams in a waiting list and we would appreciate your kindness in leaving an open slot if you will not be participating in the challenge in the end.


If you have any questions, feel free to contact the organizers via email: vcc2018@vc-challenge.org

Thank you!
